# Movie List App

## Instructions

To run and test the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/shrayanshjain9/movie-list-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd movie-list-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Challenge Elements

### Infinite Scroll and API Integration

I successfully implemented infinite scrolling to load more movies as the user scrolls near the bottom of the page. I integrated the API to fetch upcoming movies and handle the loading state properly. This demonstrates my proficiency in handling asynchronous operations and user interactions.

### Dynamic UI Updates

The app updates the UI dynamically based on search results and sorting. It displays either search results or sorted movies based on user actions. This showcases my ability to manage and manipulate state effectively.

## Possible Improvements

If I had 4 more hours, I would focus on the following improvements:

1. **Optimizing API Calls:** Implement caching or debouncing to avoid excessive API requests while scrolling.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improve error handling for API calls, providing informative messages for users.

3. **Unit Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of critical components.

4. **Responsive Design:** Enhance the UI to provide a seamless experience on different screen sizes and devices.

5. **Code Refactoring:** Refactor the codebase to improve code organization, modularity, and readability.

## Feedback

The challenge was well-structured and allowed me to demonstrate my skills in React, Redux, and asynchronous programming. It provided a good opportunity to showcase my proficiency in managing state, integrating APIs, and handling user interactions. Adding more specific instructions for the challenge requirements could make it even more effective.
